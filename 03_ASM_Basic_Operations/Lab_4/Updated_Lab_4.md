# Lab 4 Assembly Intermediate Instructions

## 1  Fibonacci’s revenge

Write a program that calculates the sum of all odd numbers in the Fibonacci sequence between 0 and 1,000,000.

## 2  Letter frequency

Write a program that counts the number of times the letter “a” (lowercase or uppercase) appears in the following sentence: 
Assembly is the best programming language!

## 3  Prepare for output! (Challenge Assignment)

Write a program that takes a normal 32-bit numeric value (e.g., 0xFFFFh) and converts 
it to a byte array such that it can be printed to the screen using a system call method. 
A loop is necessary for converting the numeric value to ASCII for output. Again, use a system call (e.g., int 80h) to print the value to the console (see CHAPTER 10). Calling external functions (e.g., printf) is not allowed for this assignment.
