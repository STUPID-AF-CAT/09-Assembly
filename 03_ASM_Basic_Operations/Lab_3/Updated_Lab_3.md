## 1  Will my breaker trip?

Write a program that determines the amperage that would be pulled from a standard 120-volt wall outlet by a computer with a 1200-watt power supply running at maximum power. Use the standard equation W=VA (Watts = Volts * Amperage).

## 2  Passing the class

Write a program that computes the final percentage grade of a student in a Computer Architecture class based on the following scores. The result should be a whole number (e.g., 75 to represent 75%).

The student took four exams (points earned/points possible).

• 25/30

• 89/100

• 49/50

• 80/150

## 3  Differently sized arrays (Challenge Assignment)

Write a program that multiplies each element of a WORD array by 8 and stores the new value in the same element of a DWORD array.

• The initial array should contain the values 5, 10, 15, and 20.

• The result array should contain 40, 80, 120, and 160.
