```
* 1. Integer Expression Calculation

Using the AddTwo program as a reference, write a program that calculates the following expression,
using registers: A = (A + B) âˆ’ (C + D). Assign integer values to the EAX, EBX, ECX, and EDX registers.

* 2. Symbolic Integer Constants

Write a program that defines symbolic constants for all seven days of the week. 
Create an array variable that uses the symbols as initializers.

** 3. Data Definitions

Write a program that contains a definition of each data type listed in Table listed. 
Initialize each variable to a value that is consistent with its data type.

Table: Intrinsic Data Types.
Type	            Usage
BYTE	    8-bit unsigned integer. B stands for byte
SBYTE	    8-bit signed integer. S stands for signed
WORD	    16-bit unsigned integer
SWORD	    16-bit signed integer
DWORD	    32-bit unsigned integer. D stands for double
SDWORD	  32-bit signed integer. SD stands for signed double
FWORD	    48-bit integer (Far pointer in protected mode)
QWORD	    64-bit integer. Q stands for quad
TBYTE	    80-bit (10-byte) integer. T stands for Ten-byte
REAL4	    32-bit (4-byte) IEEE short real
REAL8	    64-bit (8-byte) IEEE long real
REAL10	  80-bit (10-byte) IEEE extended real

* 4. Symbolic Text Constants

Write a program that defines symbolic names for several string literals (characters between quotes). 
Use each symbolic name in a variable definition.
