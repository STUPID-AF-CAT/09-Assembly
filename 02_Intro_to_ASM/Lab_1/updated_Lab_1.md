# Assembly Basics

1. Define four symbolic constants that represent integer 25 in decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal formats.
2. Create a data definition for a doubleword that stored it in memory in big endian format.
3. Write a program that contains two instructions: (1) add the number 5 to the EAX register, and (2) add 5 to the EDX register. Generate a listing file and examine the machine code generated by the assembler.
What differences, if any, did you find between the two instructions?
4. Given the number 456789ABh, list out its byte values in little-endian order.
5. Declare an array of 120 uninitialized unsigned doubleword values.
6. Declare an array of byte and initialize it to the first 5 letters of the alphabet.
7. Declare an unsigned 16-bit integer variable named wArray that uses three initializers.
8. Declare a string variable containing the name of your favorite color. Initialize it as a nullterminated string.
