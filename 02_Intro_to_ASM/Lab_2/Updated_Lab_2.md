# NASM Assembly Lab Exercises

1. Using expressions with symbols

Create a program for NASM that contains the following items:

• A message variable that holds the text (preserving line breaks):

You already know what the next

variable will be, don’t you?

• A length variable that holds the size of the message variable

• A length5 variable (also in the data section) that holds the result of adding 5 to length (use EQU)

• A one-operand instruction that adds 1 to the value in the length5 variable (think outside the box for this requirement)

2.  Order of operations (Challenge Assignment)

Create a program that calculates the following expression: answer = (A + B) – (C + D)

• The answer must be stored in a variable of the correct data type given your data

(A, B, C, D).

• The values for your data (A, B, C, D) must be stored in registers (e.g., eax, ebx), not variables.

• You must supply the initial values for the data (A, B, C, D).

• Create a string that could accompany the answer in an output statement

(e.g., "The answer is:"). You do not have to output the string.

• Comment each line of code, to briefly describe each line’s meaning.
